  It's evaluated before each iteration, and if it happens to be false it exits
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  This expression is checked each time before the loop runs

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It is evaluated before the evaluation of the next conditon.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
